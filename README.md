# Weather Dashboard

A dynamic and interactive **Weather Dashboard** built with Power BI using a live **Weather API**. This project fetches real-time weather data, processes it using **Power Query**, and visualizes key weather metrics for easy monitoring.

## Features

- **Current Temperature** – View the real-time temperature of any location.  
- **7-Day Forecast** – Get weather predictions for the upcoming week.  
- **Air Quality Index (AQI)** – Track the quality of air in your area.  
- **Humidity & Wind Speed** – Monitor atmospheric conditions.  
- **Sunrise & Sunset Times** – Know the exact times for your location.  
- **Chance of Rain** – Stay prepared with rain probability data.  

## Tech Stack

- **Power BI** – For creating interactive dashboards and visuals.  
- **Power Query** – To clean, transform, and prepare the data.  
- **Weather API** – Provides live weather data for various metrics.  

## How It Works

1. Connects to a live weather API to fetch up-to-date data.  
2. Cleans and transforms the data using Power Query.  
3. Displays interactive visuals for temperature, forecasts, air quality, humidity, wind, sunrise/sunset, and rain probability.
